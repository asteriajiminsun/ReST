# ReST
ResT is a testimonial-inspired noninvasive device that helps anesthesiologists perform an external jaw thrust on hospital patients under conscious sedation who may be at risk of asphyxiation.


## Description
ResT, Respiratory External Support Technology, is a device intended to assist anesthesiologists with hospital patients undergoing surgery while under conscious sedation. The problem it aims to solve is apnea --the temporary cessation of breathing-- due to the tongue falling and blocking the patientâ€™s airway during surgeries lasting anywhere between 30 minutes to 2 hours. ResT provides noninvasive external support which is easily reproducible, intuitive and can beat out the current market prices of similar devices by $200. Additionally, the ResT project reduces waste in hospitals by utilizing an easily sanitizable design and recyclable thermoplastic materials.
